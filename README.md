# hello-world
GitHub seems like a pretty neat place. Open source everything. How can I help?

I like synthesizers, audiosynthesis, data analysis, and using these tools to explore the natural world. 
I've used open source software for most of my projects and would like to contribute to the community that 
has created most of the tools I use in my artistic practice. Thanks for all the fish.
